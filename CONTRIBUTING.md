# Contributing Guide

Yo. Thanks for wanting to help out. We appreciate it. 
But before you open a PR, read this so we don't have to close it.

## 🛑 The Rules

1.  **No Abandonware:** If the tool hasn't been updated since 2023, don't bother. We only want active projects.
2.  **No Skids:** We need actual tools, not just a script that prints "HACKED" in green text.
3.  **Check Duplicates:** CTRL+F is your friend.
4.  **Format Matters:** Follow the existing table format. If you break the markdown, we break your PR.

## 📝 How to Add a Tool

1.  Fork the repo.
2.  Add your tool to the correct category.
3.  Use this format:
    ```markdown
    | **[ToolName](URL)** | Short description (max 10 words). | Status |
    ```
4.  Submit PR with a description of *why* this tool is good.

## 🔗 Reporting Dead Links

If a tool is 404 or the repo has been archived/deleted, open an Issue with the tag `dead-link`. We'll bury it.
